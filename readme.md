requirements.txt lists all the Python dependencies.
Setup Guide
1. Clone the Repository
Start by cloning the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
2. Install Dependencies
Install the required Python packages using the requirements.txt file:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Download and Set Up ChromeDriver
You need to download and install ChromeDriver that matches your version of Google Chrome:

Check your Chrome version by navigating to chrome://settings/help in your Chrome browser.
Download the corresponding version of ChromeDriver and extract it.
Place the chromedriver executable in a location that's in your system's PATH or specify the path directly in the code (line 19 in app.py).
4. Running the Web Scraper
You can now run the web scraping tool. It will prompt you to enter the candidate's name and the search URL (or use the default URL for the Punjab Assembly website).

Run the following command to start the script:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
5. Saving Data
Once the script runs, the following files will be generated in the output directory:

JSON File: Contains structured information about the candidate.
CSV File: Contains the same information in CSV format.
The files will be stored in a subfolder named after the candidate.

Example
bash
Copy code
Enter the candidate's name: Syed Yawar Abbas Bukhari
Enter the search URL:
(default: https://www.pap.gov.pk/members/contactdetails/en/21?bycontact=true) 
The script will search for the candidate on the given URL, extract the details, and save the information in the output/Syed Yawar Abbas Bukhari/ folder as a JSON and CSV file.

Troubleshooting
Ensure your ChromeDriver version matches the installed Chrome version.
If the scraper fails to find the candidate, ensure the spelling of the candidate's name matches the website.
Future Enhancements
Handle more dynamic content loading cases.
Add better error handling and retry logic.
Improve support for other political websites.
